      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">Effective date: 30 May 2024 • Last reviewed: current release</p>
      <p>MetalliCult (“we”, “our”, “us”) is an independently run fan site for Metallica followers. We respect your privacy and process personal data in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other applicable laws. This notice explains what we collect, how we use it, and the rights available to you.</p>

      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <p><strong>Device and usage data:</strong> We collect technical details such as IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, pages viewed, and timestamps to diagnose issues, improve performance, and maintain security. These logs are stored with minimal retention.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Analytics and affiliate programs may place cookies or pixels to measure traffic and attribute purchases. We aim to keep non-essential tracking limited and disclose when third-party scripts are present.</p>
      <p><strong>Contact information:</strong> If you email us or submit a request, we process your name, email address, and message contents to provide support.</p>
      <p><strong>Affiliate interaction data:</strong> When you click outbound links to Merchbar or other merchants, they may track the click to confirm commissions. Those partners maintain their own privacy policies and consent tools.</p>

      <h2>How we use data</h2>
      <p>We use the information above to operate and secure the site, respond to questions, understand which articles or buying guides are helpful, and comply with affiliate program requirements. We never sell personal information. Data is processed based on consent (for optional cookies), legitimate interests (site security, content delivery), and contractual necessity (responding to your inquiries).</p>

      <h2>Data sharing and partners</h2>
      <p>We share limited data with trusted providers: hosting and security vendors, privacy-focused analytics services, and affiliate networks that attribute purchases. When you click a link to the <a href="https://www.merchbar.com/search?q=metallica%20shirt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merchbar Metallica collection</a> or a specific product such as the <a href="https://www.merchbar.com/hard-rock-metal/metallica/metallica-kill-em-all-bolur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kill &#39;Em All shirt</a>, Merchbar may set cookies to ensure artists are paid. We encourage you to review their privacy terms and those of FlexOffers or any other affiliate network we use.</p>

      <h2>Retention and security</h2>
      <p>We retain personal data only as long as needed for the purposes described. Logs and analytics are typically aggregated or deleted after short retention windows. We use HTTPS, access controls, and least-privilege practices to safeguard data, but no method is 100% secure. Please notify us if you suspect a vulnerability or unauthorized access.</p>

      <h2>Your rights and controls</h2>
      <p>Depending on your region, you may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information. You may also object to certain processing, ask us to restrict use, or request a portable copy of data you provided. California residents can request details on data categories collected and ask for deletion without discrimination. To exercise these rights, contact us using the details below and we will verify your request before acting.</p>
      <p>You can manage cookies through your browser settings, opt out of non-essential analytics where offered, and enable Global Privacy Control or Do Not Track signals. We will honor applicable signals where required by law.</p>

      <h2>International transfers</h2>
      <p>Our hosting and service providers may operate in multiple countries. When data moves outside your region, we use appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses, data processing agreements, and technical protections to keep your information safe.</p>

      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>MetalliCult is intended for fans aged 16 or older (or the age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child provided information, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.</p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to exercise your rights, email us at privacy@metallicult.example. We aim to respond within 30 days and faster for urgent security matters.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update this notice to reflect new features or legal requirements. We will revise the “Effective date” above when changes are posted and encourage you to review the policy periodically.</p>
