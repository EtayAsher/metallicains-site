      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="meta">Effective date: 30 May 2024 • Updated for latest compliance review</p>
      <p>Welcome to MetalliCult. By accessing this website, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the site. We may update these terms from time to time; the latest version will always be posted here.</p>

      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>MetalliCult is an independently operated fan hub that provides reviews, buying guides, and affiliate links for Metallica merchandise. We are not affiliated with Metallica, their management, or any official label. All trademarks, album art, and logos belong to their respective owners and are referenced for identification only.</p>

      <h2>User responsibilities</h2>
      <p>You agree to use the site only for lawful purposes. You will not attempt to disrupt or interfere with the site, harvest data, submit malicious code, or violate applicable laws. If you submit feedback or contact us, you represent that the information is accurate and does not infringe the rights of others.</p>

      <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>All original text, design elements, and compilations on MetalliCult are owned by us or our licensors. You may view and share links to our pages for personal use. Commercial reuse, scraping, or redistribution requires written permission. We do not claim ownership of Metallica-related intellectual property; those marks remain with their rightful owners and are used nominatively to discuss products and music.</p>

      <h2>Affiliate relationships</h2>
      <p>Some pages include outbound links to merchants such as Merchbar and partner networks like FlexOffers. When you click these links and make a qualifying purchase, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you. Product availability, pricing, shipping, and returns are controlled by the merchant. We encourage you to review each merchant’s terms and privacy policy before purchasing.</p>

      <h2>Content accuracy and availability</h2>
      <p>We strive for accurate, timely information, but we cannot guarantee completeness. Inventory, pricing, and promotions can change without notice. The site is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue content at any time, including removing outdated product links if they become unavailable or non-compliant.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the site, reliance on recommendations, or interactions with third-party merchants. Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction is to stop using the site.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>In no event will MetalliCult’s total liability exceed one hundred U.S. dollars (USD 100) or the amount you paid to us, if any, for accessing the site during the twelve months before the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so these may not apply to you.</p>

      <h2>Third-party links</h2>
      <p>Our site contains links to third-party websites, including the <a href="https://www.merchbar.com/search?q=metallica%20shirt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merchbar Metallica catalog</a> and specific items such as the <a href="https://www.merchbar.com/hard-rock-metal/metallica/metallica-kill-em-all-bolur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kill &#39;Em All shirt</a>. We do not control these sites and are not responsible for their content, policies, or availability. Visiting them is at your own risk.</p>

      <h2>Governing law and disputes</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by the laws of your place of residence unless local law requires otherwise. Any disputes will be resolved in competent courts within that jurisdiction. You agree to bring claims individually and not as part of a class action, except where prohibited by law.</p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>For questions about these Terms of Service, please email legal@metallicult.example. We will review and respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
